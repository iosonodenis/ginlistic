Roku Gin is a premium Japanese gin that is produced by the House of Suntory. The name "roku" means "six" in Japanese, and this gin gets its name from the six traditional Japanese botanicals used to craft it. In addition to these six botanicals, Roku Gin also includes eight other traditional gin botanicals, resulting in a complex and balanced flavor profile.

The six traditional Japanese botanicals used in Roku Gin include sakura flower, sakura leaf, yuzu peel, sencha tea, gyokuro tea, and sansho pepper. These botanicals are carefully selected and harvested in various regions throughout Japan, each with their own unique characteristics and flavors.

Roku Gin is distilled using a traditional Japanese method called "shinsuji," which involves a slow distillation process at a low temperature to preserve the delicate flavors and aromas of the botanicals. The resulting gin is smooth and well-balanced, with a floral and citrus-forward flavor profile that is distinctly Japanese.

Roku Gin is often served in a traditional gin and tonic, garnished with a slice of fresh ginger and a sprig of shiso leaf to enhance its unique flavor profile.

## What makes the Roku Gin special

Roku Gin is a Japanese craft gin made by the Suntory company, which has been in the spirits industry since 1899. What sets Roku Gin apart is its unique blend of botanicals, which include six traditional Japanese botanicals (sakura flower, sakura leaf, yuzu peel, sencha tea, gyokuro tea, and sansho pepper) as well as eight traditional gin botanicals (juniper berry, coriander seed, angelica root, angelica seed, cardamom seed, cinnamon, bitter orange peel, and lemon peel). The use of these Japanese botanicals gives Roku Gin a distinct and subtle flavor profile that sets it apart from other gins. Additionally, Roku Gin is distilled using a unique method that involves the use of six different types of pot stills, each of which extracts a different flavor element from the botanicals.
