## What makes the Ungava Gin special

Ungava Gin is a Canadian gin that is made with handpicked botanicals from the tundra of northern Quebec, Canada. The gin's unique flavor profile comes from the use of botanicals that are not commonly found in other gins, including Nordic juniper berries, wild rose hips, cloudberry, and crowberry.

These botanicals are selected for their unique flavors and are carefully blended to create a gin that has a bright, citrusy flavor with floral and herbal notes. Additionally, the gin gets its distinctive yellow color from the use of locally harvested Labrador tea. The combination of these unique botanicals creates a gin that is smooth, complex, and flavorful.
