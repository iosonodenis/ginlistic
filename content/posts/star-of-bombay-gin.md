The Star of Bombay is a premium gin produced by Bombay Sapphire, a well-known gin brand. It was launched in 2015 as a super-premium expression of their classic Bombay Sapphire gin. The Star of Bombay takes its name from a famous Indian sapphire, which was the inspiration for the gin's distinct flavor profile.

The gin is made using a slow distillation process in copper stills, which helps to create a smooth and rich flavor profile. The botanicals used in the gin include juniper, coriander, angelica root, almonds, lemon peel, orris root, grains of paradise, cassia bark, and liquorice. Additionally, the Star of Bombay features two additional botanicals not found in the original Bombay Sapphire recipe: dried bergamot orange peel and ambrette seeds.

The result is a gin with a complex and layered flavor profile that features notes of juniper, citrus, spice, and floral undertones. The Star of Bombay is bottled at a higher proof than Bombay Sapphire, which further emphasizes its robust flavor profile.

Overall, the Star of Bombay is a premium gin that is well-suited for sipping neat or in a classic gin and tonic cocktail.

## What makes the Star of Bombay Gin special

The Star of Bombay Gin is a premium gin produced by the Bombay Sapphire distillery, known for its unique flavor profile and high quality ingredients. The gin is made with a blend of 12 botanicals, including juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, and orris root, as well as two additional botanicals: bergamot orange peel and ambrette seed.

The Star of Bombay is distinguished by its higher alcohol content, coming in at 47.5% ABV compared to the standard 40% ABV for most gins. This higher alcohol content allows the flavors and aromas of the botanicals to be more concentrated, resulting in a more intense and complex gin.

The gin also undergoes a unique vapor infusion process during distillation, which involves passing the spirit through a basket of botanicals suspended above the liquid, rather than adding the botanicals directly to the pot. This method is said to create a more delicate and nuanced flavor profile, as the botanicals are able to infuse into the spirit more gently and gradually.
