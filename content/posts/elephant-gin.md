## About the Elephant Gin

Elephant Gin is a premium handcrafted gin made in Germany using 14 botanicals, including rare African ingredients such as baobab, Buchu plant, and African wormwood. The name Elephant Gin was inspired by the founders' love for Africa and their desire to support African elephant conservation. A portion of the proceeds from every bottle sold goes to charities that work to protect elephants and their habitats in Africa. The brand also uses sustainable and ethically sourced ingredients, and their production process minimizes waste and energy consumption. The gin has a complex yet smooth flavor profile with prominent notes of juniper, pine, and citrus, as well as subtle hints of spice and floral.

## What makes the Elephant Gin special

Elephant Gin is a unique gin brand that stands out for its commitment to conservation and sustainability. The gin is inspired by Africa's beauty and wildlife, and the company donates 15% of its profits to two African elephant foundations. In addition to its philanthropic mission, Elephant Gin uses high-quality botanicals such as African wormwood, baobab, and devil's claw, which gives it a distinctive taste that sets it apart from other gins. The gin is distilled using traditional methods in Germany and is bottled at 45% ABV to maintain its full flavor. Its unique taste and social responsibility make it a popular choice among gin enthusiasts.

The producers of Elephant Gin recommend using a neutral tonic water with their gin, such as Fever-Tree Indian Tonic Water or Schweppes Indian Tonic Water. However, the choice of tonic water is ultimately a matter of personal preference, and you may want to experiment with different options to find your favorite pairing.
