Hapusa Gin is an artisanal gin produced in India by the Nao Spirits & Beverages company. It is a premium quality gin that is inspired by the unique botanicals found in the Himalayan region of India. Here are some of the key features and characteristics of Hapusa Gin:

- Botanicals: Hapusa Gin is made using a blend of 12 botanicals, six of which are native to the Himalayas. These include juniper, coriander seeds, turmeric, mango ginger, cardamom, and gondhoraj limes. The other botanicals used include angelica root, liquorice, orris root, almond, and cassia bark.
- Production: Hapusa Gin is produced using a traditional copper pot still and is distilled in small batches. The gin is made using the London Dry method, which means that all the botanicals are added during the distillation process, and no artificial flavors or colors are added.
- Flavor profile: Hapusa Gin has a complex and unique flavor profile that is dominated by the juniper berries, but also has notes of citrus and spice. The addition of Himalayan botanicals gives the gin a distinct earthy and herbal flavor that sets it apart from other gins.
- Bottle design: The bottle design of Hapusa Gin is inspired by traditional Indian brass and copper vessels used for storing water and other liquids. The shape of the bottle is also reminiscent of the Himalayan mountains.
- Awards: Hapusa Gin has won several awards since its launch, including a gold medal at the 2020 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

Overall, Hapusa Gin is a premium quality gin that is well-crafted and offers a unique flavor profile that is inspired by the Himalayan region of India.
