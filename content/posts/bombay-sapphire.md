## About the Tanqueray London Dry Gin

Bombay Sapphire was first introduced in 1987 and has since become a popular gin brand worldwide. Bombay Sapphire is a London Dry Gin that is made using a unique blend of ten botanicals, including juniper berries, coriander, angelica root, lemon peel, and grains of paradise.

The recipe for Bombay Sapphire gin is based on a 1761 recipe developed by Thomas Dakin, who is considered to be one of the forefathers of English gin. The gin is distilled using a vapor infusion process, which helps to preserve the delicate flavors of the botanicals and gives the gin its distinctive taste.

When you taste Bombay Sapphire gin, you will notice a smooth and complex flavor that is characterized by notes of citrus, spice, and juniper. The finish is long and smooth, with a hint of sweetness that lingers on the palate. Bombay Sapphire is often used in classic gin cocktails like the gin and tonic and the martini, as well as in modern gin drinks.

Overall, Bombay Sapphire is a high-quality gin that is well-regarded for its flavor, quality, and versatility.
