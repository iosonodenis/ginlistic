Nordés Gin is a Spanish gin that is distilled in the northwest region of Galicia, known for its Celtic heritage and unique botanicals. It was first introduced in 2013 and has gained popularity for its distinctive flavor and bottle design.

One of the main botanicals used in Nordés Gin is the Albariño grape, which is commonly used to produce white wine in the Galicia region. Other botanicals include juniper, cardamom, ginger, hibiscus, and eucalyptus. These ingredients create a floral and herbaceous flavor profile that is both complex and refreshing.

Nordés Gin is typically bottled at 40% ABV and is often enjoyed in a Gin and Tonic garnished with a slice of grapefruit or lime to complement the gin's botanicals.

## What makes the Nordés Gin special

Nordés Gin is a Spanish gin that stands out for its unique flavor profile and use of local Galician ingredients. The gin is made using a base of traditional botanicals like juniper, cardamom, and ginger, but it also includes several ingredients native to the Galician region of Spain, such as wildflowers, eucalyptus, and samphire.

One of the most notable botanicals in Nordés Gin is the Albariño grape, a white grape variety that is widely grown in Galicia and is used to make some of the region's most famous wines. The grape gives the gin a fruity and floral flavor profile that sets it apart from other gins.
