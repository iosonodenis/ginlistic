## About the Gin Mare Mediterranean Gin

Gin Mare is a premium gin that is distilled in a small fishing village on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. It is known for its unique flavor profile that incorporates botanicals that are common in the Mediterranean region. The name "Mare" means "sea" in Italian, which reflects the brand's focus on the flavors and culture of the Mediterranean.

Gin Mare is made using a blend of nine different botanicals, including juniper berries, coriander seeds, cardamom, and citrus peels. However, it is the use of more unique botanicals that sets Gin Mare apart from other gins. These include arbequina olives, rosemary, thyme, and basil, which give the gin a distinctly herbal and savory flavor.

Gin Mare is distilled in small batches using a traditional copper pot still. The botanicals are steeped in neutral grain spirit for 24 hours before being distilled, which allows the flavors to fully infuse into the spirit. The resulting gin is then bottled at 42.7% ABV.

Gin Mare is best enjoyed in a gin and tonic, garnished with a sprig of rosemary and a slice of lemon or lime. It can also be used in a variety of gin cocktails, such as a Negroni or a Martinez, to add a unique twist to classic recipes.


## Why you should pick a Gin Mare Mediterranean Gin

Gin Mare Mediterranean Gin is considered special due to its unique botanical ingredients that are sourced from the Mediterranean region. The gin is made using a combination of arbequina olives, thyme, rosemary, and basil, which are all native to the Mediterranean area. These botanicals give the gin a distinct flavor profile that is often described as herbaceous, aromatic, and savory.

In addition, Gin Mare is produced using a unique maceration process that involves each botanical being macerated separately in a neutral spirit for a specific amount of time before being blended together. This process is said to give the gin a more complex and well-balanced flavor.

Overall, Gin Mare Mediterranean Gin is known for its high quality, unique flavor, and focus on using locally-sourced ingredients. It is a popular choice for those looking for a gin with a distinctive taste that pays homage to its Mediterranean roots.
