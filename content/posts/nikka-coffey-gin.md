Nikka Coffey Gin is a premium Japanese gin produced by Nikka Whisky Distilling Company, which is known for its award-winning whiskies. The gin is made using a unique Coffey still, which was originally designed by Aeneas Coffey in the 19th century, and is rarely used for gin production. This still allows the distillers to create a high-quality spirit with a silky texture and a depth of flavor.

The botanicals used in Nikka Coffey Gin are sourced from all over Japan, including yuzu from the north, sansho pepper from the central area, and kabosu and amanatsu from the south. Other botanicals include juniper berries, angelica root, coriander seeds, lemon peel, and orange peel. The result is a complex and well-balanced gin with a unique Japanese twist.

Nikka Coffey Gin has won numerous awards, including a Double Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2018 and a Gold Medal at the International Wine & Spirit Competition in 2017. It is best enjoyed in a classic gin and tonic, with a twist of grapefruit or yuzu, or in a Japanese-inspired cocktail such as a Martini with umeshu and shiso.
