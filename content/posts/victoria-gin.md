Victoria Gin is a small-batch, handcrafted gin produced in British Columbia, Canada. It is made with locally sourced, organic botanicals, including juniper, rose petals, coriander, citrus peel, orris root, and cinnamon. The gin is distilled using a copper pot still, which is said to produce a smoother and more nuanced flavor.

Victoria Gin is known for its balanced and complex flavor profile, with prominent notes of juniper and citrus, as well as hints of floral and spice. It has won several awards for its quality, including a Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

In addition to its signature gin, Victoria Distillers also produces a number of other spirits, including a pink gin, a barrel-aged gin, and a range of liqueurs.
