Citadelle Gin is a premium French gin that is distilled in Cognac, France. It is produced using 19 botanicals, including juniper berries, coriander, angelica, licorice, orange peel, lemon peel, cassia bark, nutmeg, cardamom, and grains of paradise.

One of the unique things about Citadelle Gin is that it is distilled in small batches in a traditional copper pot still over an open flame, which is said to give the gin a fuller, richer flavor. Additionally, Citadelle Gin is aged for several months in oak barrels before bottling, which helps to mellow the gin and give it a smooth, well-rounded flavor.

Citadelle Gin has won numerous awards for its quality and taste, including a Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and a Double Gold Medal at the Fifty Best Gin Awards. It is considered a classic gin that is perfect for use in a variety of cocktails or simply enjoyed neat over ice.

## What makes the Citadelle Gin special

Citadelle Gin is a small-batch gin produced in France that uses a unique combination of 19 botanicals to create a complex and well-balanced flavor profile.

One of the things that sets Citadelle Gin apart is the inclusion of French juniper berries, which are known for their sweet, floral aroma and delicate flavor. In addition to juniper, Citadelle Gin also includes several other botanicals that are not typically found in gin, such as yuzu, savory, and star anise, giving it a distinct and exotic character.

Finally, Citadelle Gin is distilled in small copper pot stills and aged in oak casks for several months, which imparts a smooth and mellow finish.
