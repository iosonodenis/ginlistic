Citadelle Gin is a premium French gin that is distilled in Cognac, France. It is produced using 19 botanicals, including juniper berries, coriander, angelica, licorice, orange peel, lemon peel, cassia bark, nutmeg, cardamom, and grains of paradise.

One of the unique things about Citadelle Gin is that it is distilled in small batches in a traditional copper pot still over an open flame, which is said to give the gin a fuller, richer flavor. Additionally, Citadelle Gin is aged for several months in oak barrels before bottling, which helps to mellow the gin and give it a smooth, well-rounded flavor.

Citadelle Gin has won numerous awards for its quality and taste, including a Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and a Double Gold Medal at the Fifty Best Gin Awards. It is considered a classic gin that is perfect for use in a variety of cocktails or simply enjoyed neat over ice.
