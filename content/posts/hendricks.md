Hendrick's Gin is known for its unique flavor profile, which is achieved through the use of a blend of eleven botanicals, including juniper, coriander, and citrus peel, as well as more unusual ingredients such as cucumber and rose petals.

Hendrick's Gin is distilled using a small-batch method that involves the use of both a copper pot still and a rare Carter-Head still, which helps to preserve the delicate flavors of the botanicals. When you taste Hendrick's Gin, you'll notice a distinctively floral and citrusy flavor, with a subtle hint of cucumber that adds a refreshing quality to the gin.
