## About the Empress 1908 Gin

Empress 1908 Gin is a Canadian gin that is named after the Fairmont Empress Hotel in Victoria, British Columbia. The gin is known for its distinctive purple color, which comes from the infusion of butterfly pea flower petals during the distillation process. In addition to the butterfly pea flower, the gin is also made with eight other botanicals, including juniper, coriander, grapefruit peel, ginger root, and rose petal.

One of the unique aspects of Empress 1908 Gin is that its color changes when mixed with tonic water or citrus juice. The addition of acid changes the pH of the gin, causing it to change from purple to pink. This makes for an interesting and visually appealing cocktail experience.

Empress 1908 Gin has won numerous awards and is popular among gin enthusiasts who appreciate its complex flavor profile and stunning appearance. It can be enjoyed on its own or in a variety of cocktails, including gin and tonics, martinis, and even a purple-hued gin sour.
