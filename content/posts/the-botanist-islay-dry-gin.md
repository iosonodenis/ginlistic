The Botanist Islay Dry Gin is a premium gin produced by the Bruichladdich Distillery, which is best known for its whisky production. This gin is made from 22 hand-foraged botanicals from the island of Islay, Scotland, including wild Islay juniper, apple mint, chamomile, heather, and thistle, as well as a few other secret ingredients.

The gin is distilled in a unique Lomond still, which was originally designed to produce whisky but has been adapted for gin production. The use of this still allows the distillers to carefully control the intensity of the botanical flavors, resulting in a complex and well-balanced gin.

The Botanist Islay Dry Gin has a smooth and elegant taste, with notes of citrus, herbs, and spice. It has won numerous awards for its quality and is highly regarded by gin enthusiasts around the world.

## What makes the The Botanist Islay Dry Gin special

The Botanist Islay Dry Gin is unique in that it is made with a combination of 22 hand-foraged botanicals from the Scottish island of Islay, where it is produced.

The gin is also distilled using a unique process that involves using both a pot still and a Lomond still, which is a type of column still. This allows for greater control over the distillation process and results in a complex and flavorful gin with a distinctly Islay character.
