      <description>Ungava Gin is a premium Canadian gin made by the Ungava Spirits Co. and named after the Ungava Peninsula in the far north of Quebec, Canada. The gin is made using botanicals native to the Arctic region, including wild rose hips, cloudberry, Labrador tea, crowberry, Arctic blend, and Nordic juniper, which give it a distinct and refreshing flavor.
Ungava Gin is also known for its vibrant yellow color, which comes from the infusion of the botanicals and herbs during the distillation process.</description>
