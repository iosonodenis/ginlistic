      <description>About the Elephant Gin Elephant Gin is a premium handcrafted gin made in Germany using 14 botanicals, including rare African ingredients such as baobab, Buchu plant, and African wormwood. The name Elephant Gin was inspired by the founders&amp;rsquo; love for Africa and their desire to support African elephant conservation. A portion of the proceeds from every bottle sold goes to charities that work to protect elephants and their habitats in Africa.</description>
