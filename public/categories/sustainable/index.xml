      <description>About the Elephant Gin Elephant Gin is a premium handcrafted gin made in Germany using 14 botanicals, including rare African ingredients such as baobab, Buchu plant, and African wormwood. The name Elephant Gin was inspired by the founders&amp;rsquo; love for Africa and their desire to support African elephant conservation. A portion of the proceeds from every bottle sold goes to charities that work to protect elephants and their habitats in Africa.</description>

      <description>Greater Than London Dry Gin is made with 9 botanicals, including juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, orris root, lemon peel, orange peel, licorice, fennel, and chamomile. The gin is made in small batches using a copper pot still, and the botanicals are steeped in a neutral spirit for 24 hours before distillation.
The resulting gin has a crisp and citrusy flavor profile, with notes of juniper, lemon, and coriander. It is smooth and well-balanced, with a clean and refreshing finish.</description>
