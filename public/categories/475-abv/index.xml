      <description>The Star of Bombay is a premium gin produced by Bombay Sapphire, a well-known gin brand. It was launched in 2015 as a super-premium expression of their classic Bombay Sapphire gin. The Star of Bombay takes its name from a famous Indian sapphire, which was the inspiration for the gin&amp;rsquo;s distinct flavor profile.
The gin is made using a slow distillation process in copper stills, which helps to create a smooth and rich flavor profile.</description>
