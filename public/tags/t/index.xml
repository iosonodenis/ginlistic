      <description>About the Tanqueray distillery Tanqueray was first produced in England in the 1830s and has since become a popular gin worldwide. Its distinctive taste is attributed to a unique blend of botanicals, including juniper, coriander, angelica root, and liquorice. In addition to its classic London Dry Gin, Tanqueray also produces a range of other gins, including Tanqueray No. Ten, which is made with fresh citrus fruits, and Tanqueray Rangpur, which is distilled with Rangpur limes for a citrusy twist.</description>
