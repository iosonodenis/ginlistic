      <description>Jaisalmer Indian Craft Gin is a premium gin produced by Radico Khaitan, a well-known Indian distillery that has been in operation since 1943. The gin is named after the Jaisalmer Fort, a historic landmark in the Indian state of Rajasthan.
Jaisalmer Indian Craft Gin is made with a blend of 11 botanicals, including juniper berries, coriander seeds, lemon peel, and cubeb berries, which are all sourced from around the world. In addition to these traditional gin botanicals, the recipe also includes Indian botanicals such as darjeeling tea and lemongrass, giving the gin a unique flavor profile that is both familiar and exotic.</description>
